    <div class="education-entry">
        <h3>Tharaka University</h3>
        <p><strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> (2023 – Present)</p>
         <p>
        My time at <strong>Tharaka University</strong> has been a journey of growth, leadership, and discovery. While pursuing a 
        <strong>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science</strong>, I actively served as the 
        <strong>Student Representative</strong> for the <strong>Faculty of Physical Engineering and Technology (FPET)</strong>. 
        I also held a leadership position in the <strong>Christian Union (CU)</strong>, where I developed strong communication, 
        teamwork, and mentorship skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Campus life has fueled my passion for technology and design, leading me to self-learn web development, graphic design, 
        and video editing. It continues to shape my professional mindset and creativity as I grow both technically and personally.

        <h3>Kiurani High School</h3>
         <p>
        I attended <strong>Kiurani High School</strong>, where I completed my secondary education between 2019 and 20212. 
        During my time there, I served as a <strong>Christian Union (CU) Leader</strong>, which helped me build strong leadership, 
        public speaking, and organizational skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I did not study computer studies, my interest in technology began shortly after high school. This curiosity 
        drove me to pursue computer science at the university level and explore creative and technical fields like web development, 
        graphic design, and video editing.
